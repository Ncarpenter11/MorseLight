# MorseLight
An iPhone app to translate english into Morse code and flash Morse code through your phone's flashlight

This application is not finished yet. As of right now, all i really have is a rough user interface and a rough patch of
software.

To run, try to avoid long sentences for now, as well as punctuation or non alphanum characters. type your statement into the
UIlabel, press 'Translate!' to translate, and your Morse translation will appear where the 'type something in' label is.
